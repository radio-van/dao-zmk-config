# NOTE
See full README at [master](https://github.com/radio-van/dao-zmk-config/tree/master) branch.  
This is an experimental branch to check some layout ideas.

Based on [yumagulovrn/dao-zmk-config](https://github.com/yumagulovrn/dao-zmk-config)


# Experiment
Idea: use tap-dance for placing some symbols such as dot, minus, etc on homerow.
Use semantic placing, e.g. **E** -> **E**qual -> `=` 
Pros: easy-to-reach symbols
Cons: interferes with normal typing
Further: 
- use tripple tap?
- use macro with trans

Current tap-dances:
    * C - Ctrl+C
    * D - comma
    * E - equal
    * F - dot
    * G - grave
    * H - ESC
    * J - ESC
    * M - minus
    * P - plus
    * Q - question
    * T - tilda
    * V - Ctrl+V
    * U - underscore
